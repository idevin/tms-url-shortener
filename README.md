# U.short

Shorten urls with Python django framework

## Getting Started

Dummy package for shorten urls like bit.ly service

### Prerequisites

Linux system is preferable.
Project needs some widget tweaks for pretty forms so we can install it using pip:

```
pip install django-widget-tweaks
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
cd SRC_FOLDER_PROJECT
```

```
virtualenv -p python3.6
```

```
.env/bin/activate
```

```
./manage.py makemigrations
```

```
./manage.py migrate
```

```
./manage.py createsuperuser
```

```
./manage.py runserver
```
